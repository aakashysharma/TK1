The folder contains: 
- src - a sub folder containing the source code of the entire assignment divided among: 
 - ***client***
 - ***impl*** 
 - ***resources***
 - ***server***
- client.policy  - Policy files linked with client
- server.policy  - Policy files linked with server
- build.xml - Ant Script used to build the project.
 
#####Build & Run
 
Ant Script is meant to build the assignment/project.
- For building the Project use the command ```ant```. 
If you run ```ant``` without target, it will build all the targets.
Thus, compiling the whole project.
- After compiling, you can execute the Project by running the command ```ant run```.
- Clean build can be performed by running the command ```ant clean```, followed by running the command ```ant```.
